This is the repository for my personal portfolio website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Overview
The index.html file contains the HTML structure for the website, including a header with a navigation bar, a main section with three sections, and a footer. The style.css and app.css files are used to style the content on the page. The app.js file uses the Fetch API to retrieve data from a JSON file named project-data.json. The JSON data is then used to dynamically create HTML elements for each project and append them to the page.
